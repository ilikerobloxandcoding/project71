          The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier's. For an educational institution an auditorium
          is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation
          of students and scholars congregate - to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn
          collectively.</p>

          with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed description of their ingredients help both students and
          parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
          provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
          and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can
          eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
          Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-1g-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
        Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
        management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data
        entry, this accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
        <br>
        2. Economics
        Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end
        to inaccurate time reporting. buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter
        of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,000 per employee after
        implementing automated attendance management systems.
        <br>
        3. Productivity / Efficiency
        Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes
        time to procces paper sheets and time card, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll
        manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping
        track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort
        saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity
        and improves profits. And many more like Visibility / Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management,
